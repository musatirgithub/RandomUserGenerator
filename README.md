<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've generated random user cards by fetching values from "https://randomuser.me/api". For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I've declared my variables,</li>
  <li>Then added an event listener to button's click event,</li>
  <li>In that event I've defined two functions. First one is an async function and handles fetching data from "https://randomuser.me/api" and converting the data to Json,</li>
  <li>Second function gets required data by destructuring and then places these data to respective HTML elements by manipulating DOM,</li>
  <li>Finally by calling the function code works as intended.</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. Hope you like the project! </li>
</ul>
